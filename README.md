# Roborace-Robot
Roborace is a competition with autonomously/radio controlled/wired driven, electrically powered vehicles and bot cars.
Me and my team were the 3rd runner up at IIT Ropar in this event.  



Roborace is a competition with autonomously/radio controlled/wired driven, electrically powered vehicles and bot cars.

Roborace as a whole is a competition where people can showcase their technical skills. RoboRace is a competition where couple of Robots compete with each other in their speed and accurate control. 

Unique Selling Points: 

1. The weight of the bot was around 1.2kgs (excluding power source).
2. The size of the bot was in a box favoured dimensions of 20 X 17 X 15 cm.

Tools used in this project: 

1. Arudino microcontroller was used to carry out the signal processing received from the transimmiter to the reciver and then carry out the functioning and motioning of the bot. 
2. A 1500MAH lipo battery was used, which gave it a functioing time of around 10-15 mins. 
3. Four(4) 150rpm single shaft BO(battery operated) DC motors were used which gave a good amount of torque at low voltage.
4. An ESC(electronic speed controller) was used to control the speed of the bot. The ESC recieved the signal from the ardiuno and processed it to the motors, which in return helped to control the speed of the bot. 
5. RF transmitter and reciever. They were used to control and give functions to the bot. 
6. For the CAD model design of the chasis and the assembly of the bot solidworks was used.


Learning Outcomes: 

1. Learned about I2C signal protocol of the arduino which was used in the transimission and reciveing of the commands.
2. Learned about RF tranismission. 
3. Dived deep into DC motors and its manufacturing and functions.
